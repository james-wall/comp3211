Biggest coding project from COMP 3211 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence) with Professor Dekai Wu,
taken at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Part 1 is an implementation of permutation sort in Chicken Scheme.

Part 2 takes two inputs:
-A dictionary that contains a training set of Strings
-An input Strings

The algorithm then determines all valid anagrams of the input String based upon the words in the training set.
