##COMP 3211, Final Coding Assignment
### The Hong Kong University of Technology
####Spring, 2016

Biggest coding project from COMP 3211 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence) with Professor Dekai Wu,
taken at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

**Part 1** is an implementation of permutation sort in Chicken Scheme.
Notice that permute always returns #f. The permutations must be displayed to standard output, not returned. 
This is to avoid building enormous lists in memory 

**Part 2** takes two inputs:
-A dictionary that contains a training set of Strings
-An input Strings

The algorithm then determines all valid anagrams of the input String based upon the words in the training set.

Relevant technologies:
- Chicken Scheme
- Functional Programming
